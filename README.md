# Km the library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FreekKalter/km-lib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FreekKalter/km-lib)

Lib behind a webapp to register kilometers driven in a company car.
Probably not very usefull for anyone else at this point.
Looking to extract a more generaly useful lib from this for a simple CRUD app.
